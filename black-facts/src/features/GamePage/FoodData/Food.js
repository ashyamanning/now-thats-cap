                        but in Morocco my host mother wakes up at the crack of dawn to 	steam, steam again, and re-steam 
                        these grains into a mountain of fluffy deliciousness. It is served with meats, vegetables, and 
                        sometimes with caramelized onions and raisins (called Tfaya), or even made as a desert!`

        answer:'Collard Greens',
        region:'North America',
        description:`Collard greens have been cooked and used for centuries. The Southern style of cooking of greens 
                    came with the arrival of African slaves to the southern colonies and the need to satisfy their 
                    hunger and provide food for their families. Though greens did not originate in Africa, 
                    the habit of eating greens that have been cooked down into a low gravy, and drinking the juices 
                    from the greens (known as “pot likker”) is of African origin. The slaves of the plantations were
                    given the leftover food from the plantation kitchen.Some of this food consisted of the tops of 
                    turnips and other greens.  Ham hocks and pig’s feet were also given to the slaves.
                    Forced to create meals from these leftovers, they created the famous southern greens. 
                    The slave diet began to evolve and spread when slaves entered the plantation houses as cooks. 
                    Their African dishes, using the foods available in the region they lived in, began to evolve into
                    present-day Southern cooking.`

        description:`Ndolé is one of the two national dishes of Cameroon, traditionally made with boiled bitterleaf,

                    or meat. This flavorful stew is usually served with bobolo – fermented cassava shaped into a loaf.

                    also be accompanied by fufu corn, yams, rice, or fried plantains as side dishes.`

        description:`The cuisine had its origins with the Taino, who developed the jerk method and later taught
                    it to African slaves, who in turn adapted it in creating jerk chicken. ... The word jerk 
                    reportedly stems from the Spanish charqui, meaning dried strips of meat similar to the 
                    modern-day jerky.`
