### Black History Month "Just Build" One Week Hackathon

### #NowThatsCap, a Frontend Web Application inspired by Black New York City culture, is the easy and breezy solution to accessing all the knowledge you already know, the things you need to know and the things you wouldnâ€™t want to know but are still equally as important as to not allow the world to re-write history. Africa is the motherland and black culture is the blueprint and it was our mission to showcase that.

### With the amount of overwhelming events that have occured in the past 2 to 3 years, we know how daunting learning new and unbiased information can be so we wanted to make sure it would be a good time.
